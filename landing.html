<h2> Morning Glory<h2>
<p> Considering that I saw three other bug friends on this plant I would most certainly give it a try. It makes me curious, perhaps the equilivant to seeing customers waiting outside a busy pop-up shop in NYC. I think this plant would be sweet and refresing just like drinking orange juice on a sunny morning. </p>

<h2> Hedge Parsley<h2>
<p> This plants thin and sharp shape reminds me of something that might taste bitter. This is simply due to the fact that often times the flavor profile of small foods tend to have more of a punch. I think If i were a bug it would be too strong for my little tastebuds. </p>

<h2> Dead Leaf<h2>
<p> Ummmm yea no. This plant is rotten. I would not dare to take a bite of this plant and give my poor little bug tummy a stomach ache. The last thing I would need is to miss my shift being a worker for my ant colony </p>

<h2> Magnolia Tree Leaf<h2>
<p> Yeaaa I am not sure about this one too doc.The little brown spores look moldy so i think it mught taste rotten within that area. I will sayy maybe this plant is like cheese in the manner that cheese is natrually moldy on the outsude but great on the inside. So maybe just a small nibble.</p>

<h2> Oak Sapling<h2>
<p> Not sure if you can notice the texture too much, but when i felt this plant in person it was veryyy dry. Due to this I think that it would make me want to drink more water. I Would have to travel far for water in this Texas heat which puts me at risk for birds (AHHHHH) so I think I might pass on this guy.  </p>

<h2> Raintree Leaf<h2>
<p> I had no problems with this leaf whatsoever. It actually looked very yummy from the perspetive of a bug. I would even go as far to say I would take a nice little nap on this leaf. </p>

<h2> Mustang grape<h2>
<p> NOOOOOOOOOO. This plant looks even more dry tgan the Oak sapling leaf. Taking a bite of this plant looks like the equilivant of eating a spoonful on sand...ew </p>

<h2> Milkweed<h2>
<p> Milkweed is invasive, think about this plant as your local chick-fla. Can't go wrong with it, it has a good taste, its easy and always there. For consistency and always being on the market its a pretty solid choice. If my bug wife ask me to bring home takeout I know this can be my fallback choice. </p>

<h2> Invasive Privet<h2>
<p> I have some mixed feelings about this plant. Its texture reminded me of something that had been sitting out. Now this does not mean it cannot still be yummy. Sometimes leftovers still taste gas. I think that this leaf could have the potential to be very yummy </p>

<h2> Polemonium Reptans<h2>
<p> Another dry plant we have...smh. I will say I cannot tell if the holes are from other bug friends. If that is the case I mighttt try it but even then it still looks a little too meh for me. I think an example would seeing people in line for a resturant i feel is mid.This is me just be being a pretentious bug.  </p>
