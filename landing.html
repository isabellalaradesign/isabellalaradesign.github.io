    <h1>PLANT AND BUG INDEX</h1>

      <p style="color: white;"> 
        Have you ever looked at a plant and went wow, it is so beautiful.
        <br>
        <br>
        It made me wonder what do different bugs think when they look at plants. Then it HIT me. They look at them and must think wow that looks so yummy. Soooo, I present to you Plants I would eat if I were different bugs.

<h2> Hedge Parsley<h2>
<p> This plants thin and sharp shape might be a challenge to get around. I think If i were a bug i think i would prefer other plants that could hold me up more.

<h2> Dead Leaf<h2>
<p> You might be thinking a dead leaf why would you eat that. Well bugs still eat dead leafs! If i were a bug I would use as shelter or a nice ground snack

<h2> Oak Sapling<h2>
<p> Due to how low this specific plant was to the ground it would put me at risk for birds (AHHHHH) so I think I might pass on this guy.

<h2> Raintree Leaf<h2>
<p> This leaf actually looked very yummy. I would even go as far to say I would take a nice little nap on this leaf considering it was in a well shaded area.

<h2> Mustang grape<h2>
<p> It might be a little hard too see in the picture but this leaf was massive. In fact it was the 2nd biggest leaf in the index. With this being said - More food!

<h2> Invasive Privet<h2>
<p> This plant had incredible protection. The way these leafs herd together would make it very hard to attack me while I let my guard down and eat.

<h2> Polemonium Reptans<h2>
<p> This was the biggest plant in the entire index. Due to size, shade from predators I would have to eat this plant for sure.
